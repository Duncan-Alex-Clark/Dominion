PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A2*A5)+(A2*(~A5)*(~A3))+((~A2))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#2 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net QCS_4_Top_i/QCS_4_wrapper_0/inst/QCS_4_i/clk_cascade_0/inst/counter_reg[19]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin QCS_4_Top_i/QCS_4_wrapper_0/inst/QCS_4_i/clk_cascade_0/inst/counter_reg[19]_i_1/O, cell QCS_4_Top_i/QCS_4_wrapper_0/inst/QCS_4_i/clk_cascade_0/inst/counter_reg[19]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
